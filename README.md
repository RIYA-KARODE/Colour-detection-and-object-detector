# Colour-detection-and-object-detector
Object detection and segmentation is the most important and challenging fundamental task of computer vision.  It is a critical part in many applications such as image search, scene understanding, etc. However it is still an open problem due to the variety and complexity of object classes and backgrounds.An object has many global features like color and shape, which describe the object as a whole. These features can be utilized for the detection of an object and tracking it in a sequence of frames. In this section, we will use color as a feature to detect an object with a particular color. This method is useful when an object to be detected is of a specific color and this color is different from the color of the background. If the object and background have the same color, then this method for detection will fail. We will try to detect any object with a blue color from a webcam stream using OpenCV and CUDA.
